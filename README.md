## Description

- The Horiseon-Refactoring-Project was designed to help new students get used to reviewing and refactoring html & css by supplying some example code that could be optimized and improved by applying several fundamental best practices with an emphasis on accessibility.

- There were several features such as broken links, lack of semantic html usage which affected accessibility, and excessive or unnecessary css found throughout the example code provided.

    How to properly use html elements semantically to improve the accessibility by replacing many <div> elements with their approprite counterparts.
